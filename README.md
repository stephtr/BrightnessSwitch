This small app automatically switches between Windows' Light- and Dark-Theme, depending on the ambient brightness, detected via your device's light sensor.

In order to control the switching mechanism, it adds a tray icon where one can enable or disable automatic switching of themes, but also an option to manually switch the theme.

If automatic switching is enabled and one switches the theme, machine learning (support vector machine, to be precise) is being used for optimizing the automatic switching mechanism.

## Download

- .zip package: [Latest release](https://github.com/stephtr/BrightnessSwitch/releases)
- Installer: coming soon...
- Microsoft Store: under consideration

## Running the app

The app is written in C# (.NET 5.0) and therefore needs the [Desktop Runtime 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0#runtime-desktop-5.0.0-preview.2) to be installed.

For this app there is currently no installer available, therefore just download the [latest release](https://github.com/stephtr/BrightnessSwitch/releases) and extract it to a folder of your choice. Then run `BrightnessControl.exe`, autostart with Windows can be enabled via the context menu.

## Privacy

The app itself doesn't send any data to any server. For the Microsoft Store version, Windows may send some diagnostic informations to Microsoft.

## Building from source

For building the app from scratch, you need to have the [.NET SDK 5.0 (preview)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.

After cloning or downloading the source, running `dotnet run` is sufficient for automatically restoring, building and running the app.

Included with the source is also a small Python script for analysing the app's SVM configuration. By running `analysis.py`, it shows a plot containing all your recent manual interventions as dots. The vertical line corresponds to the criteria for switching between light and dark theme with the shaded area being a measure for the uncertainty.
